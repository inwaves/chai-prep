Test.test_simple

You are provided with a basic implementation of a decision tree. Assume discrete input features and discrete output labels. Your task is to implement the instance method DecisionTree.lookup according to the function specification in the code. You may add helper methods or modify the classes provided.

During tests, the DecisionTree will be populated for you. One test that you may find useful is Test.test_simple, which verifies the lookup returns the correct class label for every possible input feature in the following decision tree
